Vegetable Store

requirement 1: Create a web application using JSP and servlets. The website lists all the vegetables available in that stock(vegetable image, vegetable name, price, existing stock in kg, minimum order quantity in kg, etc.). The vegetables can be added, updated, and deleted as well.

requirement 2: Implement authentication and authorization. Admin can delete, update and edit the vegetable details but non-admin users can only view the vegetables. (implement security using tomcat-users.xml initially, and then implement using a MySQL database)

requirement 3: Convert the application to a maven application
